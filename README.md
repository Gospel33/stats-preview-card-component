## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt a lot during the course of making this stats preview component card but what was most striking was the use of media queries which help us determine and evaluate the apprearance of our design across various devices such as mobile phones, tablets and desktops/laptops. I learnt also that i could make my build view either mobile first or desktop first all depending on my choices.

### Continued development

I will love to be able to experiment more with the media query css function and maybe possible try building mobile first before going for desktop view with all my future projects.

### Useful resources
